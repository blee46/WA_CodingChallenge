# WA_CodingChallenge

I used OpenCV, Matplotlib, and NumPy libraries fot this coding challenge.
I tried to use image clustering and thresholding as well as contour to detect the boundaries of the line that the red cones are forming. 
However, my answer.png does not match with the sample answer and I think it is because of the way the line fitting is performed using np.polyfit.
